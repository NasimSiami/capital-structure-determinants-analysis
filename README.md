# Determinants of Capital Structure – Empirical Corporate Finance

This project analyzes the factors influencing capital structure decisions of publicly traded firms. It was developed as part of a graduate course in corporate finance at HEC Montréal and is based on the methodology outlined in the accompanying academic literature.

## 📘 Overview

The goal of this analysis is to empirically test how firm-level characteristics affect leverage ratios, drawing from key corporate finance theories such as the **Pecking Order Theory** and the **Trade-off Theory**. The notebook performs a detailed regression analysis using cleaned and transformed financial data.

## 🔍 Key Variables Analyzed

- **Leverage Ratio**: Total Debt / Total Assets  
- **Profitability**: EBIT / Total Assets  
- **Firm Size**: Log of Total Assets  
- **Tangibility**: Net Fixed Assets / Total Assets  
- **Growth Opportunities**: Market-to-Book Ratio

## 🧪 Methodology

- Data preprocessing and variable transformation using pandas  
- OLS regression analysis using `statsmodels`  
- Interpretation of coefficient signs, magnitudes, and statistical significance  
- Hypothesis testing of financial theories
